## TODOS before completion:
1. Fuzzy can probably be reused in libzhuyin as well as libpinyin? Clean up and move to core, make it only initialize with configuration.
2. Engine can probably be merged(same for pinyin and zhuyin) as well, should be fairly similar in behavior, just data and parser that is different. 
3. (remove json metadata output, figure out what metadata is even needed)
