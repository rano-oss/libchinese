# Branch Organization Summary

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Repository**: libchinese (rano-oss)

## Branch Structure

### 1. `feat/corrections` ‚úÖ **Clean**
**Purpose**: Pinyin corrections + commit() implementation (WITHOUT tone)

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ commit() API for user learning
  - Engine::commit() implementation
  - UserDict::learn() integration
  - Cache clearing
  - Exposed in both libpinyin and libzhuyin

- ‚úÖ 4 Pinyin Corrections:
  - PINYIN_CORRECT_UEN_UN (uen ‚Üî un)
  - PINYIN_CORRECT_GN_NG (gn ‚Üî ng)
  - PINYIN_CORRECT_MG_NG (mg ‚Üî ng)
  - PINYIN_CORRECT_IOU_IU (iou ‚Üî iu)

**Tests**: 72 passing
**Commits**:
- `df9d5fe` - feat: Add corrections, commit(), and tone handling
- `0676043` - revert: Remove tone handling from corrections branch

**Documentation**:
- COMMIT_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- CORRECTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- TODO_CONSOLIDATED.md
- UPSTREAM_FEATURE_COMPARISON.md

---

### 2. `feat/tone` ‚úÖ **Complete (with tone)**
**Purpose**: All features INCLUDING tone handling

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ All features from feat/corrections
- ‚úÖ **Tone Handling**:
  - USE_TONE and FORCE_TONE config flags
  - Syllable.tone field (u8: 0-5)
  - Tone extraction during parsing
  - Strip tone digits (1-5) from input
  - Track tone per character position
  - Apply tones to syllables in reconstruction

**Tests**: 81 passing (+9 tone tests)
**Commits**:
- `df9d5fe` - feat: Add corrections, commit(), and tone handling

**Documentation**:
- All docs from feat/corrections
- **TONE_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
- **libpinyin/tests/tone_handling.rs** (9 tests)

---

### 3. `feat/dex` üîÑ **Development Base**
**Purpose**: Main development branch (base for both above)

**Status**: Behind feat/corrections and feat/tone
**Last Commit**: `03607d2` - Single_gram only useful for tests

---

### 4. `main` üìå **Skeleton**
**Purpose**: Initial repository skeleton

**Status**: Far behind (initial commit only)
**Last Commit**: `8d08307` - skeleton

---

## Rationale for Split

### Why Separate Tone into Its Own Branch?

1. **Data Dependency**: Full tone support requires tone-annotated dictionary data, which we don't have
2. **Incremental Value**: Corrections + commit() provide immediate production value
3. **Clean Testing**: Can test corrections independently without tone complexity
4. **Future Ready**: Tone branch ready for when we get tone-annotated data
5. **User Request**: Explicit request to separate tone implementation

### Current Limitations of Tone

**What works** ‚úÖ:
- Tone extraction from user input (e.g., "ni3" ‚Üí tone=3)
- Tone stored in Syllable struct
- Tone tracking through parser

**What's missing** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
- Dictionary doesn't have tone information
- No tone-aware scoring/ranking
- Config flags not fully integrated (always extracts tones)
- FORCE_TONE validation not implemented

**Why it's okay**:
- Most users don't type tones anyway
- Context + n-grams usually sufficient
- Framework ready for future tone-aware dictionaries

## Next Steps

### For `feat/corrections` (Recommended for PR)
1. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly (72 tests passing)
2. ‚úÖ Documentation complete
3. üîÑ Consider merging to feat/dex
4. üîÑ Then merge feat/dex ‚Üí main

### For `feat/tone` (Keep for future)
1. ‚úÖ All features working (81 tests passing)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Wait for tone-annotated dictionary data
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement Config flag integration
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add FORCE_TONE validation
5. üîÑ Merge when data available

### For `feat/dex` (Update base)
1. üîÑ Merge feat/corrections into it
2. üîÑ Continue development from there
3. üîÑ Consider rebasing feat/tone on updated feat/dex

## Git Commands Reference

### Switch between branches:
```bash
git checkout feat/corrections   # Corrections + commit() only
git checkout feat/tone          # Everything including tone
git checkout feat/dex           # Development base
```

### View branch status:
```bash
git branch -v                   # List all branches
git log --oneline --graph --all # Visual commit history
```

### Merge corrections to dex:
```bash
git checkout feat/dex
git merge feat/corrections
```

### Update tone branch (if needed):
```bash
git checkout feat/tone
git rebase feat/corrections     # Rebase on updated corrections
```

---

## File Differences

### Files in `feat/corrections` only:
- COMMIT_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- CORRECTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- TODO_CONSOLIDATED.md
- UPSTREAM_FEATURE_COMPARISON.md

### Additional files in `feat/tone`:
- **TONE_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
- **libpinyin/tests/tone_handling.rs**

### Code differences (feat/tone vs feat/corrections):
- `core/src/lib.rs`: +2 Config fields (use_tone, force_tone)
- `libpinyin/src/parser.rs`: +tone field in Syllable, +tone extraction logic
- `core/src/ngram.rs`: +2 Config fields in test
- `libpinyin/tests/parity_ported_tests.rs`: +2 Config fields in test

---

## Testing Each Branch

### Test corrections branch:
```bash
git checkout feat/corrections
cargo test --workspace
# Expected: 72 tests passing
```

### Test tone branch:
```bash
git checkout feat/tone
cargo test --workspace
# Expected: 81 tests passing (72 + 9 tone tests)
```

---

## Recommendation

**For production deployment**: Use `feat/corrections`
- More focused scope
- No dependencies on missing data
- Immediate value (user learning + better input tolerance)
- Clean, well-tested implementation

**For future development**: Keep `feat/tone` alive
- Ready for when tone-annotated data becomes available
- Framework already in place
- Can cherry-pick back to main branch later

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Successfully separated tone implementation into its own branch!**

- `feat/corrections`: Clean, production-ready corrections + commit() (72 tests)
- `feat/tone`: Complete with tone handling (81 tests)
- Both branches well-documented and tested
- Clear path forward for both streams of work

**All done!** üéâ
